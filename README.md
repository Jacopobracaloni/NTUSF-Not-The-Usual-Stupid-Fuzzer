## A smart vulnerability scanner powered by Machine Learning
The advent of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning has unlocked a plethora of possibilities across various sectors, cybersecurity being a notable example. In this domain, the effectiveness of intrusion detection systems has significantly increased. This thesis presents a novel tool that integrates these technological fields by relying on machine learning to analyze a collection of web application URLs to identify the most likely vulnerable ones. Equipped with attack modules addressing the OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities, this software not only detects possible exploits but also generates omprehensive infographics to illustrate its findings. To validate its practicality, the software was also applied to a live web application, underscoring its real-world use-case.
